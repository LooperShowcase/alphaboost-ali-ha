    <p>
      Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology
      company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. It is the world's
      largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue,[4][5] and is the
      developer of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in
      most personal computers (PCs). Incorporated in Delaware,[6] Intel ranked
      No. 45 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States
      corporations by total revenue for nearly a decade, from 2007 to 2016
      fiscal years.[7] Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system
      manufacturers such as Acer, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures
      motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated
      circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other
      devices related to communications and computing. Intel (integrated and
      electronics) was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers
      Gordon Moore (of Moore's law) and Robert Noyce, and is associated with the
      executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. Intel was a key component
      of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high-tech center. Noyce was a key
      inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip).[citation needed] Intel was
      an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the
      majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's
      first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success
      of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business.
      During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs
      fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period,
      Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was
      known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market
      position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a
      struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC
      industry.[8][9] The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP
      and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source projects such as Wayland,
      Mesa, Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.[10]
